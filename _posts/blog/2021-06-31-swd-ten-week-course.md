From April to June of 2021 I took part in the [Storytelling With Data](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/) ten week online course lead by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic (Founder and CEO of SWD) and Alex Velez (Data Storyteller with SWD). Each week's class and materials focused on a topic relating to data visualization, communication, and design. The course utilized a wide variety of media and learning methods such as podcasts, videos, blog posts, books, storyboarding, and sketching with pencil and paper which helped make it engaging and fun. The class culminated with creating and presenting a data story on a topic of the student's choosing, with the goal of applying just about everything that was covered over the ten weeks. 

As part of taking the class we received two [SWD books](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/books), one that covers concepts advocated by the SWD team for communicating effectively and impactfully with data, and another that consists of hands on exercises to practice applying those concepts. We also received access to SWD members only and class participant content on the SWD website.

We met over Zoom on Mondays for an hour each week for a lecture and discussion on the week's theme. For each week we were given around six to eight types media to watch, listen, or read; opportunities for practicing some of the concepts we were being taught; and a single "synthesize" activity we turned in by posting it on the class website where we would recieve feedback from Cole, Alex, and other students from the class. In addition to the final project, the synthesize activities were the only other required activities for receving a certificate of completion for the class. Overall, I felt that the materials and assignments were tenable to do while working full time.

Having come into the class with considerable experience as a data visualization developer and while working as a UX Engineer at Google at the time, I felt that my experience largely resided more on the technical aspects of creating interactive data visualizations for the web for _exploratory_ purposes and that I lacked experience in creating data visualizations for _explanatory_ purposes. I won't dive into detail here, but if you're not familiar with the two most common ways of utilizing visualization (exploratory and explanatory), one way of thinking about them could be a continuum where exploratory is on the left and explanatory the right:

Exploratory visualization are those that don't attempt to tell a story or message but rather invite the user to explore the data, typically through a user interface of some kind, and draw their own conclusions. Tools such as data dashboards and interactive geographic maps paired with features such as attribute filters, date time sliders, layer toggles, etc. all come to mind when I think of exploratory visualization.

Explanatory visualization on the other hand make an attempt, hopefully in good faith, to communicate an insight or hypothesis in some way to the viewer. Charts, graphs, maps, etc. in the form of data journalism from outlets such as The New York Times, Washington Post, Bloomberg, Five Thirty-Eight, and many others all come to mind. "Scrolly-telling" experiences that combine narrative text and other media with data visualization are a popular form this may take on the web as well. However, even a simple, static chart that is intuitive, well designed, and paired with a good title and/or caption can be an excellent explanatory data visualization.

I mentioned that the two forms of visualization can be thought of as a continuum as hybrid approaches often take shape. One form of this could be a "scrolly-telling" or other type of interactive visualization that communicates a story using data but then invites the viewer to explore the data on their own. Perhaps this could take the form of encouraging the viewer search for their home town or city to see how the data used in the story relates to their local community.

- what I learned / took away from it
	- exploratory vs. explanatory analysis
	- understanding how to use the right type of chart for an explanatory analysis
	- tips for effective chart design 
	- tips for effective use of color
	- in giving and receiving feedback, context matters
	- utilizing narrative to help people listen to and remember what you're communicating
	- importance of understanding your audience
	- it's for your audience, not you
	- how to plan and give an effective presentation that communicates a data story
	- 

- what I wish the class did more of or differently
	- ways of communicating other than presentation
	- more time for feedback / critique on the final projects

_I'd like to thank [Zan Armstrong](https://www.zanarmstrong.com/) for recommending the SWD ten week class to me and introducing me to the SWD website, its community and resources. Thank you Zan!_
