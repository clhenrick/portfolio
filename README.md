# Portfolio
Personal portfolio and blog of Chris Henrick using the [Feeling Resposive](http://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/) Jekyll theme with some added style tweaks (dark theme) and personal touches. Forked from [Phlow](https://github.com/Phlow/feeling-responsive).

This site is live at [clhenrick.io](http://clhenrick.io).

## Develop
Make sure you have Ruby and Jekyll installed.

To run this site in a Jekyll dev environment, from the root of this repo do:

```bash
jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml
```

## Deploy
Deployments on Netlify happen when a pull request is merged into the master branch.

## Creating the Portfolio
To migrate work from an [existing portfolio](http://chrishenrick.com), I created `JSON` data containing information for each project. This data lives in `_data/work.json`. A [Node.JS script](./scripts/make-portfolio-posts.js) generates a markdown file for each project and creates the portfolio overview page in `./work/`.

Updating the portfolio works like this:  

1. Edit `_data/work.json` as needed.
2. `cd scripts/ && npm install`
3. from the `scripts/` dir do `node make-portfolio-posts.js`

## Adding a New Project
To add a new project add a new object entry to the `work` array in `_data/work.json` containing the following attributes:

- "title" : required: title of the project
- "tags" : an array of relevant tags
- "description" : a short description shown in `/work/`
- "description_long" : a long description shown in the corresponding project page
- "thumb" : required: thumb nail image
- "tech" : an array containing the names of whatever tech was used
- "video" : an object containing the following if the project has a video
  - "url" : link to a video if the project has one  
    ( eg: "https://vimeo.com/81728484")
  - "embed" : link to the embed url for the video  
    (eg: "https://player.vimeo.com/video/81728484")
- "imgs" : required: an array of any images associated with the project
- "size" : size to give to the project that corresponds to a `CSS` class
  (depreciated / unnecessary)
- "date" : date the project was created in the format of Year-Month-Day, eg: "2014-11-02"

Then `cd` to the `scripts` dir and do `node make-portfolio-pages.js`
