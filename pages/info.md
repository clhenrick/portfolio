Chris Henrick currently lives in Brooklyn, NY and recently graduated from the [Parsons MFA Design and Technology program](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-design-technology/) at the New School in New York City. His thesis at MFA DT was a web app he conceptualized and coded called [Am I Rent Stabilized?](https://amirentstabilized.com) that seeks to solve the problem of NYC landlords lying to tenants about being rent-regulated and illegally deregulating rent-stabilized apartments. You can learn more about it in an [article he wrote for Urban Omnibus](http://urbanomnibus.net/2015/05/using-open-data-to-strengthen-tenants-rights-activism/). 

Prior to attending Parsons Chris worked as a Cartographer and GIS specialist at [Avalon Travel Publishing](http://www.travelmatters.com/) in Berkeley, CA. Before that he worked as a GIS / Cartographer intern at [GreenInfo Network](http://www.greeninfo.org/) in San Francisco, CA. Additionally, Chris has performed consultant work for the [Oakland Museum of California](https://www.museumca.org/), as well as for a number of independent and self-published authors. His undergraduate degree is in Geography and Urban Studies, from Temple University in Philadelphia, PA. 

In his spare time Chris helps organize and facilitate [Maptime NYC](http://www.meetup.com/maptime-nyc), a volunteer group dedicated to educating non-experts about GIS, cartography, and interactive web-mapping.
