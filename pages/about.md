Chris Henrick is a **creative technologist** and **educator** who currently lives in Oakland, California and who's work spans the domains of web development, data visualization, Geographic Information Systems, and cartographic design. Most recently he has worked as a lecturer for the University of California's [School of Information](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/); a full stack web developer for [GreenInfo Network](http://greeninfo.org), a non-profit GIS and cartography shop; and as a design technologist for [Stamen Design](http://stamen.com/about/), an internationally renowned data visualization and web cartography design studio. 

Chris is an alum of the [Parsons MFA Design and Technology program](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-design-technology/) at the New School in New York City. His thesis at MFA DT was a web app he conceptualized and coded called [Am I Rent Stabilized?](https://amirentstabilized.com) that seeks to solve the problem of NYC landlords lying to tenants about [rent-stabilization](http://www.nycrgb.org/html/resources/faq/rentstab.html#exactly) and illegally deregulating rent-stabilized apartments. You can learn more about it in an [article he wrote for Urban Omnibus](https://web.archive.org/web/20170917134036/http://urbanomnibus.net/2015/05/using-open-data-to-strengthen-tenants-rights-activism/).

When not at work Chris enjoys bicycling, hiking, Iyengar Yoga, and playing percussion. Outside of his day to day work, he has assisted with organizing and facilitating [Maptime](http://maptime.io/), a community of professionals dedicated to creating a safe and welcoming space to educate non-experts about GIS, cartography, and interactive web mapping, free of charge.
