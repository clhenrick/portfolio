## Intro

Recently I've been trying out [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html), and had an opportunity to use them in a project to animate a data visualization rendered using SVG. The project I worked on called for a zoom in and out animation on one of the SVG's child elements, triggered by the browser's y scroll position.

In this project I used a combination of [D3JS](https://d3js.org/) and React for creating the data visualizations. I decided on taking the approach of only using D3 for non-DOM mutation tasks such as generating complex [SVG path commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/d) from GeoJSON, then handing those off to a React component for rendering the SVG Path to the DOM.

An alternative approach to combining D3 and React is to use a combination of [d3-selection](#) and React's [ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) utility to allow D3 to render the part of the DOM which contains the visualization (aside: this is the approach I typically take when using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) with React). The benefit of this approach is that if you already know D3JS, you can continue developing similar to how you normally would without React. However, some in the data visualization developer community believe that this approach should generally be avoided as it 1. means having two different libraries handle DOM updates and therefore introduces more code complexity, and 2. this forgoes React's diffing algorithm which helps make DOM updates fast (Amelia Wattenberger ran [some benchmarking tests](https://twitter.com/Wattenberger/status/1123413424678027265) that seem to show React is faster at updating the DOM than D3).

There has been a lot written on the subject of various methods of combining React and D3, which I won't go into in this post any further. If you're interested in learning more I encourage you to take a look at the writings and presentations of data vis folks such as [Shirley Wu](http://slides.com/shirleywu/deck#/4), [Amelia Wattenberger](https://wattenberger.com/blog/react-and-d3), and [Thibaut Tiberghien](https://medium.com/@tibotiber/react-d3-js-balancing-performance-developer-experience-4da35f912484).

Anyway, the trade off I ran into with using the first approach is that I lost D3's magical animation capabilities (referred to as "transitions") that belong to the [d3-transition](#) module. In order to animate (or transition) part of the DOM with D3, you need to `select` it, which you can't do without using `d3-selection`. So the question then became, how would I create this animation?

## The Solution

I ended up deciding to use a combination of the [requestAnimationFrame API](#), React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, and D3's `interpolateZoom` method. This ended up working quite nicely, and I was pleased with the results. Unfortunately due to the confidentiality of the project, I can't show the actual source code here, so instead I've ported the demo from the [d3.interpolateZoom documentation on Observable.com](https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-interpolatezoom?collection=@d3/d3-interpolate) written by [Philippe Rivi√®re](https://twitter.com/recifs) (thank you Phillipe!) to React in order to demonstrate the technique.

**_Pssst!_** _If you'd like to skip to the final code, check out [the demo on codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-d3-animation-with-hooks-wz8cl)._

### SVG Zoom Transforms and Interpolation

I want to start off by saying that `d3-interpolate` is such a handy module. It allows for you to interpolate not just numbers, but colors, strings, arrays, objects, and dates! Take a look at the [d3-interpolate documentation on ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/collection/@d3/d3-interpolate) for plenty of examples and explanations of how the various interpolators work.

While I'm using `d3.interpolateZoom` for this tutorial, there are also interpolators for both SVG and CSS transform strings. The benefit of using `d3.interpolateZoom` over these other interpolators is that it uses an algorithm for smooth zooming and panning developed by [Jarke van Wijk and Wim Nuij](http://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/zoompan.pdf).

Okay so the first thing to know about `d3.interpolateZoom` is that similar to other `d3-interpolate` methods in that given two arguments, starting and ending transform values, it will return an interpolator function. Both the start and end values are expected to be tuples consisting of three numbers. The first two numbers represent the center of the transform's `x` and `y` coordinates, while the third number represents the `size` or scale of the transform. The interpolator function that is returned will accept a single value, `t`, which is expected to be a value between zero to one, inclusive. Zero will return the start transform, and one will return the end transform. Any value between these will be an interpolated transform between the start and end, with `0.5` being the middle point.

Phew! If that was a lot to take in don't sweat it, things should become more clear after we dig into it some more.

Say we have the following SVG graphic:

![circle and star svg]({{site.urlimg}}d3-interpolatezoom.png)

</small>

We can represent the center position and size of the circle as `[30, 30, 40]` and the star as `[135, 85, 60]`. The `size` is defined either by the object's width or height, which ever is greater. We'll refer to the first array for the circle as the "start" position and the second array for the star as the "end" position.

In order to apply the SVG transformation we need to do a little math. First we need to figure out how much to scale the SVG. The dimensions of our SVG are `260` pixels wide by `190` pixels high. To get the scale value `k`, we simply use the following calcuation:

{% highlight js %}
const width = 260;
const height = 190;
const start = [30, 30, 40]

const k = Math.min(width, height) / start[2];
// 4.75
{% endhighlight %}

So the value `4.75` is what we'll use for our `transform`'s `size` value. Now what about repositioning the SVG origin to re-center things? To do this we use some more math, which ends up looking like:

{% highlight js %}
const translate = [width / 2 - start[0] _ k, height / 2 - start[1] _ k]
// [-12.5, -47.5]
{% endhighlight %}

We may now use those values to creat our SVG transform string, which ends up being:

{% highlight js %}
const transformStart = `translate(${translate}) scale(${k})`
// "translate(-12.5, -47.5) scale(4.75)"
{% endhighlight %}

Of course we don't apply this transformation to the SVG element itself, we apply it to the top most "g" element:

{% highlight html %}
<svg viewBox="-2 -2 264 194" style="max-width: 600px">
<g id=view transform="translate(-12.5,-47.5) scale(4.75)">

  <!-- more svg markup here -->
  </g>
</svg>
{% endhighlight %}

_Note: we actually won't apply the transform string manually like above, we'll be letting React do this for us._

And here is what our SVG ends up looking like after applying the `transform`:

</small>

We use the same math for our star shape to get its `k` and `translate` values. When applied to the SVG it will end up looking like this:

![svg zoomed in on star shape]({{site.urlimg}}d3-interpolatezoom-star.png)

</small>

Cool, so we now know how to use some math to apply a "zoom" transform to either of the two objects in our SVG element! That's great, but what about the inbetween states where we are zooming from one element to the other?

Because we have the center and size values for both our starting and ending zoom positions, we can construct our zoom interpolator as follows:

{% highlight js %}
const start = [30, 30, 40]; // cx, cy, size
const end = [135, 85, 60]; // cx, cy, size
const zoomInterpolator = d3.interpolateZoom(start, end)
{% endhighlight %}

Using this zoom interpolator from D3JS with the math from above, we may create a function that given a value `t` (between `0` and `1`), will return an SVG transform string for the transition zooms between our start and end points, inclusive:

{% highlight js %}
function getTransformStr(t) {
const view = interpolator(t);
const k = Math.min(width, height) / view[2]; // scale
const translate = [width / 2 - view[0] _ k, height / 2 - view[1] _ k]; // translate

return `translate(${translate}) scale(${k})`;
}
{% endhighlight %}

In other words, when the `getTransformStr` function above recieves a value of zero, it will return the same SVG `transform` string for our circle as we calculated by hand above, and ditto for the star. Anything inbetween zero and one will return a transitional `transform` string that has been computed by `d3.interpolateZoom`'s algorithm.

This `getTransformStr` function will come in handy later when when using React's `useEffect()` hook to animate our SVG. Let's move on to how to apply this function in conjunction with the browser's `requestAnimationFrame API`.

### Applying requestAnimationFrame

[smooth zooming demo by bostock](https://observablehq.com/@d3/smooth-zooming?collection=@d3/d3-interpolate)

One important part of this animation is that it had to be triggered programatically, I wanted the vis to wait to animate until the user scrolled to a certain part of the page.
